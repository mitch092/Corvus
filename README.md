# Corvus
Corvus is a modern C++ standard library. It is implemented using [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), which means that the tests are written first.

- Corvus does not depend on anything other than itself. Not even the C++ standard library/STL.
- The project that tests Corvus is called Corax (mentioned in the CMakeLists.txt file).
- Corax depends on Corvus, doctest and nothing else. Again, there are no references to the C++ standard library/STL.

For now, Corvus is a header only library built with CMake. But in the future I would like to change it to use C++20 modules.
Right now, there is no way (that I know of) for CMake to create and expose a C++20 module based library.
